## Introduction

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with TensorFlow, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python:** Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install TensorFlow:** Open your terminal and run the following command to install TensorFlow:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```
3. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpansethi30/tensorflow-tutorials.git
   ```
4. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd tensorflow-tutorials
   ```
